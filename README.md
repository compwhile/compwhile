# compwhile

compwhile is an open source project to enhance and level up your study of programming languages in Computability Theory course.

The compwhile core library is wrapped inside a web application to create a powerful web IDE for editing and running computer programs written in WHILE and other languages presented in the book "Computability and Complexity: From a Programming Perspective" (1997), by Neil Jones.

### Features
* Edit your programs within a web IDE - no installation required.
* Syntax highlighting and error checking.
* Build an AST of your program.
* Run your program.
* Solve programming exercises with immediate feedback.

### Want to contribute?
compwhile is written with extensibility in mind - the plugins system allows you to add support for new languages easily. Our goal is to support the following features:

* Edit and run GOTO programs
* Edit and run F/F+ programs
* Debugger
* Time complexity calculation
