# compwhile

compwhile is an open source project to enhance and level up your study of programming languages in Computability Theory course.

The compwhile core library is wrapped inside a web application to create a powerful web IDE for editing and running computer programs written in WHILE and other languages presented in the book "Computability and Complexity: From a Programming Perspective" (1997), by Neil Jones.

### Features
* Edit your programs within a web IDE - no installation required.
* Syntax highlighting and error checking.
* Build an AST of your program.
* Execute your program.
* Solve programming exercises with immediate feedback.
* Visualize your input and output of trees.

### Releases

compwhile will follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 standard](http://semver.org).

We plan to deliver our first release, v0.1.0, by the end June 2017.

Current list of features that will be implemented in v0.1.0:
* Code editing
* Syntax highlighting and error checking of a WHILE program.
* AST Visualization of a WHILE program.
* Executing a WHILE program.
* Interactive exercises in WHILE with autmoated tests and feedback.
* Tree notation and list notation visualization.

### Want to contribute?
compwhile is written with extensibility in mind - the plugins system allows you to add support for new languages easily. Our goal is to support the following features:

* Edit and run WHILE programs.
* Edit and run GOTO programs.
* Edit and run F/F+ programs.
* Debugger.
* Time complexity calculation.
